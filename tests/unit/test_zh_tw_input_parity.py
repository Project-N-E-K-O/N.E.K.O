"""Traditional/Simplified parity for the user-input matchers (issue #2500).

Second batch of the "0 hit" class: tables and regexes that get matched against
what the user actually typed. Simplified and Traditional are distinct code
points, so a Simplified-only lexicon does not degrade for a Traditional writer —
the feature simply does not exist for them.

As in ``test_zh_tw_guard_parity``, the assertions are **parity** rather than
per-case expected values: none of these matchers is supposed to care about
orthography, so parity holds by construction while a hand-written expectation
would drift as the lexicons grow.
